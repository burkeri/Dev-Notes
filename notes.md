## Procedural Programming
- type of programming commonly used before OOP and often learned first
- divided progam into a set of functions
- data is stored in variables, and functions operate on the data
- can lead to spaghetti code

## Object-oriented programming
- a programming paradign that prioritizes objects over functions
- the practice of combining a group of related variables and functions into a unit called an object
- functions are methods, variables are properties

    #### Languages that support OOP:
    - C#
    - Java
    - Ruby
    - Python
    - JavaScript

### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
    - the grouping of related variables and the functions that operate on them into objects
    - "The best functions are those with no parameters!" - Uncle Bob
    - reduces complexity of code

- Abstraction
    - hiding internal implementation details
    - simpler interface
    - reduces the impact of change

- Inheritance
    - mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code by letting an ojbect's children take on the methods and properties of the parents

- Polymorphism
    - a programming language's ability t oprocess object differently depending on their data type or class
    - refactors long, complex switch case statements
